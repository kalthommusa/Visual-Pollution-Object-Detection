# Visual Pollution Object Detection

------

This project aims to build a new field of automated visual pollution classification.


In this project, I trained a custom model using Tensorflow Object Detection API version 2 on Google Colab to detect and classify 10 types of visual pollution on street imagery taken from a moving vehicle in Saudi Arabia.


## Visual pollution types:

1- BAD BILLBOARD 

2- BROKEN_SIGNAGE 

3- CLUTTER_SIDEWALK 

4- CONSTRUCTION ROAD 

5- FADED SIGNAGE 

6- GARBAGE

7- GRAFFITI

8- POTHOLES 

9- SAND ON ROAD

10- UNKEPT_FACADE


## Technology and tools used:

* Google Colab

* Python 3.8.10

* TensorFlow 2.11.0

* Tensorflow 2 object detection API

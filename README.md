# Visual Pollution Object Detection

------

This project aims to build a new field of automated visual pollution classification.


In this project, I trained a custom model using Tensorflow Object Detection API version 2 on Google Colab to detect and classify 10 types of visual pollution on street imagery taken from a moving vehicle in Saudi Arabia.


## Visual pollution types:

● 1- GRAFFITI

● 2- FADED SIGNAGE

● 3- POTHOLES

● 4- GARBAGE

● 5- CONSTRUCTION ROAD

● 6- BROKEN_SIGNAGE

● 7- BAD BILLBOARD

● 8- SAND ON ROAD

● 9- CLUTTER_SIDEWALK

● 10- UNKEPT_FACADE


## Technology and tools used:

* Google Colab

* Python 3.8.10

* TensorFlow 2.11.0

* Tensorflow 2 object detection API

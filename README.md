# Visual Pollution Object Detection

------

This project aims to build a new field of automated visual pollution classification.


In this project, I trained a custom model using Tensorflow Object Detection API version 2 on Google Colab to detect and classify 10 types of visual pollution on street imagery taken from a moving vehicle in Saudi Arabia.


##Visual pollution types:


● GRAFFITI
● FADED SIGNAGE
● POTHOLES
● GARBAGE
● CONSTRUCTION ROAD
● BROKEN_SIGNAGE
● BAD BILLBOARD
● SAND ON ROAD
● CLUTTER_SIDEWALK
● UNKEPT_FACADE


## Technology and tools used:

* Google Colab

* Python 3.8.10

* TensorFlow 2.11.0

* Tensorflow 2 object detection API
